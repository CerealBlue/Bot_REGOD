# Bot_REGOD
A bot made for Reddit:
  Bot_REdditGathererOfData is a bot that uses Reddit's PRAW4 API (https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get data from Reddit.
  The data that this bot gets is the number of upvotes at a particular time of day. This will ultimately tell a user about the 
  best time a day a person should post to get the maximum number of upvotes. This bot will understand, in the due course of a month, 
  that certain days have higher traffic than others (Sunday's, Holiday's).
